Real time peer to peer RTS game running on WebGL

Aim

Each side has a respawn base with 10 mobile spheres (core) that project lasers to defeat enemies. When each players sphere is within range of another same side sphere there power and defence capabilities are increased. The aim is to take over the oppositions base. Care must be employed to maximise the strategic use of each core.

Resources can me discoved on the map to help boost defences and capabilities

Roadmap
